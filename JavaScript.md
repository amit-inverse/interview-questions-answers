# JavaScript Interview Questions

1. **What is JavaScript?**
    
    JavaScript is a programming language that is used to create interactive and dynamic web pages. It is a client-side scripting language that is executed by the web browser.

2. **What is the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript?**
    
    In JavaScript, null is a value that represents the absence of any object value. Undefined, on the other hand, is a value that is assigned to a variable that has not been initialized or declared. In other words, null is a value that has been explicitly set, while undefined is a value that has not been set at all.

3. **What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?**
    
    In JavaScript, == is used to compare values for equality, while === is used to compare values for equality and type. The == operator will convert the operands to a common type before comparing them, while the === operator will only return true if both operands have the same type and value.

4. **What is the difference between let, const, and var in JavaScript?**
    
    In JavaScript, let and const are used to declare variables that have block scope, while var is used to declare variables that have function scope. The main difference between let and const is that let allows you to reassign the variable, while const does not.

5. **What is the purpose of the async/await keywords in JavaScript?**
    
    The async/await keywords in JavaScript are used to write asynchronous code that looks synchronous and is easy to read and understand. The async keyword is used to define a function that returns a promise, while the await keyword is used to wait for the promise to be resolved before continuing with the execution of the function.

6. **What are closures in JavaScript?**
    
    A closure in JavaScript is a function that has access to the variables and functions defined in its outer scope, even after the outer function has returned. Closures are commonly used to create private variables and functions in JavaScript.

7. **What are higher-order functions in JavaScript?**
    
    A higher-order function in JavaScript is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function as its result. Higher-order functions are commonly used in functional programming to create reusable and composable code.

8. **What is the purpose of the map() method in JavaScript?**
    
    The map() method in JavaScript is used to create a new array by calling a function on each element of the original array. The function can be used to transform the values of the original array or to filter the array based on certain criteria.

9. **What is the purpose of the reduce() method in JavaScript?**
    
    The reduce() method in JavaScript is used to apply a function to each element of an array to reduce it to a single value. The function can be used to perform a wide range of operations, such as summing the elements of an array or finding the maximum value.

10. **What is the difference between a callback function and a promise in JavaScript?**
    
    In JavaScript, a callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is called when the first function has completed its task. A promise, on the other hand, is an object that represents the eventual completion of an asynchronous operation and can be used to handle the success or failure of the operation.

11. **What is event bubbling in JavaScript?**
    
    Event bubbling is a mechanism in JavaScript where events that are triggered on an element will also trigger on all of its parent elements. The event will start at the innermost element and propagate up through the DOM hierarchy until it reaches the document object.
