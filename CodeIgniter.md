# CodeIgniter Interview Questions

1. **What is CodeIgniter?**
    
    CodeIgniter is an open-source PHP web development framework used to build dynamic web applications. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture pattern and is known for its small footprint, performance, and ease of use.

2. **What are the features of CodeIgniter?**
    
    Some of the features of CodeIgniter include: a small footprint, easy to learn and use, good documentation, support for MVC architecture pattern, built-in database support, and good security features.

3. **What is the difference between CodeIgniter and other PHP frameworks?**
    
    CodeIgniter is known for its small footprint and performance, while other PHP frameworks may be more feature-rich but can be slower and more complex to use. CodeIgniter is also known for its ease of use and good documentation.

4. **What is the role of a Controller in CodeIgniter?**
    
    A Controller in CodeIgniter is responsible for receiving user requests, processing them, and sending back a response. It acts as a bridge between the Model and View components, and is responsible for controlling the flow of data between them.

5. **What is the role of a Model in CodeIgniter?**
    
    A Model in CodeIgniter is responsible for managing the data of the application. It interacts with the database to retrieve and store data, and provides this data to the Controller component.

6. **What is the role of a View in CodeIgniter?**
    
    A View in CodeIgniter is responsible for displaying data to the user. It receives data from the Controller component and renders it in a user-friendly way, such as through an HTML page.

7. **What is the routing in CodeIgniter?**
    Routing in CodeIgniter is the process of determining which Controller and method should handle a particular user request. It allows you to define custom URLs for your application and map them to specific Controller methods.

8. **What are hooks in CodeIgniter?**
    
    Hooks in CodeIgniter are a way to modify the behavior of the framework without having to modify the core files. They allow you to add functionality to specific points in the application's execution process.

9. **What are libraries in CodeIgniter?**
    
    Libraries in CodeIgniter are pre-written PHP classes that can be used to perform specific tasks, such as working with databases or sending emails. They can be loaded into your application and used as needed.

10. **What are helpers in CodeIgniter?**
    
    Helpers in CodeIgniter are functions that can be used to perform common tasks, such as working with URLs or formatting data. They are stand-alone functions and do not require a class to be instantiated.

11. **What is the purpose of the config.php file in CodeIgniter?**
    
    The config.php file in CodeIgniter is used to define various configuration settings for the application, such as database connections, base URLs, and encryption keys.

12. **How do you load a model in CodeIgniter?**
    
    You can load a model in CodeIgniter using the following syntax:

    ```$this->load->model('ModelName');```

    You can then access the model's methods using the following syntax:

    ```$this->ModelName->methodName();```

13. **What is the purpose of the autoload.php file in CodeIgniter?**
    
    The autoload.php file in CodeIgniter is used to automatically load certain classes and libraries when the application starts up. This can save time and reduce the amount of code needed to load these components manually.

14. **How do you set up a database connection in CodeIgniter?**
    
    You can set up a database connection in CodeIgniter by defining the database details in the config.php file, and then loading the database library in your Controller or Model. Once the library is loaded, you can use its methods to interact with the database.

15. **What is the difference between a library and a helper in CodeIgniter?**
    
    A library in CodeIgniter is a PHP class that provides specific functionality, such as working with databases or sending emails. A helper, on the other hand, is a collection of standalone functions that can be used to perform common tasks. Libraries are instantiated as objects and accessed using object methods, while helpers are simply functions that can be called directly.

16. **What are the security features in CodeIgniter?**
    
    CodeIgniter has several security features built-in, such as input data filtering to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, password hashing, and CSRF protection. It also provides various security helpers and libraries that can be used to further secure your application.

17. **What is the purpose of the URI class in CodeIgniter?**
    
    The URI class in CodeIgniter is used to extract and manipulate the current URL being accessed by the user. It can be used to retrieve segments of the URL, build new URLs, and perform other operations related to URLs.
