8. **What is a session in PHP?**

10. **What is a class in PHP?**
    
    A class in PHP is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties and methods that an object will have, and can be used to create multiple instances of the same object.

11. **What is a namespace in PHP?**
    
    A namespace in PHP is a way to group related classes, functions, and constants into a single, globally unique identifier. This helps to prevent naming conflicts and makes it easier to organize your code.

12. **What is the difference between GET and POST methods in PHP?**

   The GET and POST methods in PHP are used to send data from a web page to the server. The main difference between the two is that GET sends the data in the URL, while POST sends the data in the request body.

13. **What is the difference between the == and === operators in PHP?**

   The `==` operator in PHP is used to compare two values for equality, while the `===` operator is used to compare two values for both equality and type. For example, `5 == "5"` would be true, while `5 === "5"` would be false.

14. **What is a closure in PHP?**

15. **What is the use of the global keyword in PHP?**

   The `global` keyword in PHP is used to access a variable that is defined outside of the current function or class. It allows you to modify the value of a global variable from within a function or method.

16. **What is the use of the static keyword in PHP?**

   The `static` keyword in PHP is used to define a variable or method that belongs to the class itself, rather than to a specific instance of the class. This means that the variable or method can be accessed without having to create an instance of the class.

17. **What is a trait in PHP?**

   A trait in PHP is a way to reuse code across multiple classes without having to use inheritance. Traits can define methods and properties that can be used in multiple classes, and can be thought of as a way to add functionality to a class without having to extend it.
